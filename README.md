# Rust Atomics and Locks

Implementations from the various showcases of structures and libraries from the [Rust Atomics and Locks](https://marabos.nl/atomics/) book.

These are kept together in a single repo so that I can link to it from my notes. The code contains comments which are primarily useful for me for future reference.
